# HALT Command ([Postfix Notation Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

In this chapter you are going to extend your **processor** to support the **HALT** command.

You are going to accomplish this by implementing the following method:

```go
func (receiver *Processor) Halt() error {
	//@TODO
}
```

Of course, you will replace the `//@TODO` with actual code to make this work.
